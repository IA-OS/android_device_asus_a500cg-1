MIPI CSI CAMERA ENABLING STEPS:
-------------------------------

1. Download the repo "2014xxxx-2014_ww4x" from ultramobile-kits.org on your local build machine assuming under e.g., "iotg_w4x_tree".

2. Within your local iotg_w4x_tree, goto the path: iotg_w4x_tree/prebuilts/intel/vendor/intel/hardware/prebuilts/byt_m_crb/mipi_patches. Copy the file 'MipiPatches.tgz' into a temporary directory and then extract from it.

3. Extract CodePatches.tgz and apply CodePatch-1 to different files in iotg_w4x_tree/linux/kernel/arch/x86/configs/ and arch/x86/platform/intel-mid/device_libs/ directories

4. Apply CodePatch-2 to different files in iotg_w4x_tree/device/intel/baytrail/byt_m_crb and /baytrail/byt_m_crb/config/ directories

5. Apply CodePatch-3 to different files in iotg_w4x_tree/linux/modules/camera/drivers/media/i2c/imx/ drivers/media/pci/atomisp2/ and drivers/media/pci/atomisp2/atomisp_driver/ directories

6. Delete the contents of libcamera2 directory on the path iotg_w4x_tree/vendor/intel/hardware/libcamera2 and extract the libcamera2.tgz so that it replaces all the contents.

7. Extract the contents of prebuilts.tgz on the path iotg_w4x_tree/prebuilts/intel/vendor/intel/hardware/prebuilts/byt_m_crb/libmfldadvci/ia_imaging/ so that the prebuilt binaries are copied within this directory

8. On the path iotg_w4x_tree/vendor/intel/icc-redist-libs/linux-x86/x86/ create a directory by the name of x86-android-linux-14.0 and extract all the contents of icc-14.tgz into this

9. Rebuild your iotg_w4x_tree following instructions from the Release notes

10. Once successfully built, connect the Cynthiana Camera to the mipi csi port, boot-up the bayley bay board with the live.img. 

11. Connect to the target using adb connect <ip_address>

12. Chmod a+x for the 'insert_mipi_modules' file and push to /root/data directory on the target using 'adb push insert_mipi_modules data/.' command

13. Log onto the target by executing 'adb shell'. Goto the data directory and Execute the ./insert_mipi_modules to load the mipi modules. Verify loading using lsmod

14. Goto android home screen and click on the Black Camera icon to launch the camera app.

15. You will be able to see the video preview and capture snapshots

-----
NOTE: 
-----
1. There are known issues with the camera app working consistently. It may sometimes crash. Further investigation is under progress to address this. 
2. In the current design and implementation. Mipi CSI Camera cannot co-exist with Usb Camera. Only one of the two can be enabled for the camera application to work
